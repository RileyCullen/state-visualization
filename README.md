# Triatomine Bug Distribution on a Logarithmic Scale Since 2012

A simple visualization representing the number of Triatomine bugs found in US states since 2012.

To visualize this data, we use a cartogram where the color corresponds to the number of bugs found (i.e., the redder it is, the more Triatomine bugs found in that state). A legend is provided with the visualization showing the logarithmic scale used to map the data point to a color. A logarithmic scale was picked because of the large distribution of data (range 1 - ~6000).
